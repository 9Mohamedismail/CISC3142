**Exercise 2.1:**
	*int: an integer with the size of 16 bits.
	long: a long integer with the size of 32 bits.
	long long: a longer integer with the size of 64 bits.
	unsigned type: an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.
	signed type: A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero).
	short: short integer with the size of 16 bits.
	float: single-precision floating-point with the size of 6 significat digits.
	double: double-precision floating-point with the size of 10 significat digits.*

**Exercise 2.2:**	
*You can use a double or float, I would just use a dobule. Since double allows for a precise number, you could have the rate be something like 2.50%, Principle be 1025.20 and payment be like 2405.23 for examples. Double allows for such preciseness.*

**Exercise 2.3:**
	*The output would be: 
	32
	4294967264
	32
	-32
	0
	0*

**Exercrise 2.10:**
*All the following variables do not really have an inital value.  global_str is an empty string. global_int is just 0, local_int is an undefined value , and local_str is just an empty string.*

**Execrise 2.12:**
*(a) is not valid because it uses double and int. (c) is not a valid because of the dash (-). (d) is not valid becuase it uses numbers as the name.*

**Exercrise 2.13:**
*the value of j in the following program is 100.*

**Exercise 2.14:**
*Yes the program is legal, it prints out: 100 45.*

**Exercrise 2.17:**
*The following code prints: 10 10.*

**Exercise 2.27:**	
*(a) is not a legal initalization because &r refers to 0 and not an object. (f) is also not a legal initalization because it's a reference so it cannot be a const. All the other initalizations are legal because they follow the right rules.*

**Exercrise 2.28:**
*(a) illegal. constant cp pointer is not initalized. (b) illegal. constant p2 pointer is not initalized. (c) illegal. int ic is not initalized. (d) illegal. constant p3 pointer is not initalized. (e) legal. constant is correctly initalized.*
