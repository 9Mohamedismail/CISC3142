*(a)  -30 * 3 = -90; 21/5 = 4; -90 + 4 = -86
(b) 21 / 5 = 4; 3 * 4 = 12; -30 + 12 = -18
(c) 30 / 3 = 10; 10 * 21 = 210; 210 % 5 = 0
(d) -30 / 3 = -10; -10 * 24 = -210; -210 % 4 = 2;*

**prefix increment:** *increments the value and returns the incremented version.*
**postfix increment:** *stores the original value so that it can return the unicremented value as a its result.*

*(a) fval is a float and will be turned into a bool. if fval is a 0 then it will return 0 if its not it will return true.
(b) ival becomes a float, then it is added with fval. The result of this is then converted to a double.
(c) cval is converted to int because of ival, and then that result is converted from int to double because of dval.*
